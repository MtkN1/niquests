**Niquests** is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library. It is a drop-in replacement for **Requests** that is no longer under
feature freeze.

Niquests, is the “**Safest**, **Fastest<sup>*</sup>**, **Easiest**, and **Most advanced**” Python HTTP Client.

```python
>>> import niquests
>>> r = niquests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'application/json; charset=utf8'
>>> r.encoding
'utf-8'
>>> r.text
'{"authenticated": true, ...'
>>> r.json()
{'authenticated': True, ...}
>>> r
<Reponse HTTP/2 [200]>
>>> r.ocsp_verified
True
```

Niquests allows you to send HTTP requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data — but nowadays, just use the `json` method!

## Why did we pursue this?

We don't have to reinvent the wheel all over again, HTTP client **Requests** is well established and
really plaisant in its usage. We believe that **Requests** have the most inclusive, and developer friendly interfaces.
We intend to keep it that way. As long as we can, long live Niquests!

<small><sup>(*)</sup> performance measured when leveraging a multiplexed connection with or without uses of any form of concurrency as of november 2023. The research compared `httpx`, `requests`, `aiohttp` against `niquests`. Niquests is faster than Requests in every scenarii.</small>
